# Surfs_Up

## Overview
The purpose of our analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. 
Tasks:

 -- Get the temperature data for June and December.
 -- Store the temperatures in a list then convert them to a dataframe.
 -- Get summary statistics 
 
 Here is what we found:

## Results
-- In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

-- Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 in December -- making a .5 difference in the two different seasons

## Summary

From our data we can tell what our temperatures are but since there are other attributes to the weather such as precipitation it shows that we can run additional queries to let us know whether or not people can come and visit the shop. Some other queires we could do is to possibly to a query for a month in fall to see if our numbers would change, you could also do a query to find when temperatures start to get warmer so that you can predict when more people would come to a surf shop.
